title: Artifact Evaluation
order: 0
---

A scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond the document itself: software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on. In some cases, the quality of these artifacts is as important as that of the document itself. Last year, [84% of accepted OSDI papers](https://sysartifacts.github.io/osdi2021/call) participated in the artifact evaluation process. Based on the success of the OSDI '21 Artifact Evaluation last year, this year USENIX ATC will run an optional artifact evaluation process for the first time, in combination with OSDI.
